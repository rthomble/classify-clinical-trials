    "## Prepare Raw Data for Use in NLP Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Written By: Robert Thombley, UCSF (7/19/2018)\n",
    "Before we begin our classification task, we need to gather the raw data and put it into a form that's easily  accessible, in the proper format and conducive to working in Python. All of the raw data for this project lives at https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/browse/.  We will be using the BeautifulSoup Python library to scrape this website and harvest all of the potentially informative text from each clinical trial's description.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This website is formatted such that most clinical trials are categorized by major body system or condition, then subcategorized into sub-conditions.  The conditions are listed as headings, with each of the subconditions listed as a link underneath that heading. When we follow the subcondition link, we end up with a list of all clinical trials categorized into that condition/sub-condition bucket.  Each of the listed clinical trials here is a link to the clinical trial description page, which holds the text that we are most interested in.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As we are building our data structure without a great sense of the features we are interested in modeling, we will have to make some assumptions about the schema. Recognize that we may make a mistake here and leave out an important variable, but we'll have to cross that bridge when we get there.  For now, it seems to me that these are the interesting data points:\n",
    "* Condition name/heading: This is the bucket name into which we will try to categorize the \"other\" trials. It is a critical value and we should be able to easily subset our data structure using this key (Hint: This means we should probably be using a dictionary/hash table as our main data structure)\n",
    "* Sub condition name: We won't use this as a categorization label, but it may be a valuable piece of information.\n",
    "* Sub condition link: It might be useful to retain this, but it isn't super critical to keep around.\n",
    "* Number of trials: Could be useful for to get a sense of relative importance of sub-conditions, but it's probably not that useful.\n",
    "* Clinical Trial name: This is the actual title of the trial and is an important piece of text data.\n",
    "* Clinical Trial description page link: This will be important to retain so that we can easily add more data later\n",
    "* Clinical Trial study text: This is the actual text from the study page. I made some assumptions about what is useful and what is not, but this is our payload and the content we actually care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given the fact that the data that's available exists as heteogeneous types (ie - objects/chars/etc) and the requirement that we need to be able to easily subset by the condition heading (ie - 'cancer', 'eyes and vision', etc), this points to using a dictionary of a list of objects as our data structure, something like:"
